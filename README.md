# Learn Azure

Hello! :wave:
This repository is the home of generalised materials for learning to use Azure as a researcher.

Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/learn-azure/wiki) for information on sessions and cheatsheets.

The course roughly follows the [Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/learn-azure/blob/master/Learn_Azure_in_a_Month_of_Lunches.pdf) ebook.
